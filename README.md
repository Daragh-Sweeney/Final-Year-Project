# Fool_Me_Once
As part of final year project had the opportunity to co-publish a paper exploring the connection between motion dynamics and cognitive dynamics with regards to deception

This Repo contains the codebase used as part of this project.

The project was to create a game and use it to track user data. This data was then used to see if we could predict deception based on user movement.

Attached is the final-year-report-14376656-Daragh_Sweeney.PDF here I go into more detail about the project and results
